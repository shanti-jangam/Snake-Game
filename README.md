# Snake-Game
Snake is a classic game where the player controls a snake to collect food (pi) on a map. The snake grows longer with each food eaten. It moves in four directions, and the game ends if it hits the screen boundaries or itself. The goal is to survive as long as possible while collecting food and avoiding collisions.
